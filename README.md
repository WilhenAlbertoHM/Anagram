# Anagram
An assignment given at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where we used a heuristics function and the A* search algorithm to get the desired output. This assignment belongs to the course CS470/670 - Artificial Intelligence, taught by Professor Funda Durupinar Babur. 

This class, Anagram, attempts to convert a string (initial state) to its anagram (goal state). It contains a heuristics function that helps the A* search algorithm find the optimal path from the initial state to the goal state.
